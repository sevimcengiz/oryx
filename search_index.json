You can use anything that Pandoc’s Markdown supports, e.g., a math equation \\(a^2 + b^2 = c^2\\). The bookdown package can be installed from CRAN or Github: install.packages(&quot;bookdown&quot;) # or the development version # devtools::install_github(&quot;rstudio/bookdown&quot;) Remember each Rmd file contains one and only one chapter, and a chapter is defined by the first-level heading #. To compile this example to PDF, you need XeLaTeX. You are recommended to install TinyTeX (which includes XeLaTeX): https://yihui.name/tinytex/.

"],["features.html", "Chapter 3 Features", " Chapter 3 Features Main Page The user needs to provide parameters for the 3D multivoxel 1H-MRSI data. Required parameters: exclusion criteria for fCSF, SNR, FWHM, CRLB RF bandwidhth of the system for chemical shift correction cut-off value for the probabilistic binary map after registration Load Data Reads the raw 1H-MRSI data and LCModel otput files for raw data and Coord file visualization of spectra. Co-registration Coregisters FOV,Press-Box(VOI), all voxels of spectra considering chemical shift correction if chemical shift correction is ‘On.’ Segmentation Calculation of WM, GM, CSF fractions in each voxel of all metabolites considering chemical shift correction. FWHM-SNR Visualization of FWHM and SNR values for all voxels Included Voxels Visualization of included voxels into the 1H-MRSI data analysis after exclusion criteria values considering FWHM, SNR, CRLB, and fCSF. Metabolite Map All metabolite results are used to create metabolite maps including: concentration map, concentation map to Ins or Cr+PCr ratio CSF corrected concentration map, CSF corrected concentration map to Ins or Cr+PCr ratio. Registration Generates MNI-Registered metabolite maps including the outputs created in the previous module. ROI Analysis Region of interest (ROI) analysis at multiple brain atlases like Schafer2018 100/400 Parcels on 7 resting-state (rs-fMRI) networks* or MNI thr 0/25/50 brain regions*.

You can label chapter and section titles using {#label} after them, e.g., we can reference Chapter ??. If you do not manually label them, there will be automatic labels anyway, e.g., Chapter 5. Figures and tables with captions will be placed in figure and table environments, respectively. par(mar = c(4, 4, .1, .1)) plot(pressure, type = &#39;b&#39;, pch = 19) Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure! Reference a figure by its code chunk label with the fig: prefix, e.g., see Figure 3.1. Similarly, you can reference tables generated from knitr::kable(), e.g., see Table 3.1. knitr::kable( head(iris, 20), caption = &#39;Here is a nice table!&#39;, booktabs = TRUE ) Table 3.1: Here is a nice table!
