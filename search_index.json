"],["literature.html", "Chapter 3 Literature", " Chapter 3 Literature This is the user documentation for Oryx-MRSI, the fully-automated open-source software for post-processing and clinic analysis of in-vivo multi-slice magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). It doesn’t require high MRS experience from the user. Oryx-MRSI uses 1H-MRSI data acquired from Philips MR Scanner and anatomical images of different Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) modalities including (T1 weighted MRI (T1w-MRI), T2 weighted MRI (T2w-MRI). Example datasets included .sdat &amp; .spar of MRSI, and T1w-MRI and T2w-MRI were shared in Github repository (1 control, 1 parkinson’s disease, 4 different phantom acquisition trials for chemical shift).

If you want to install FSL into your computer, check this link If you use MAC, check this link (Advance Usage part-Using FSL from MATLAB) If you use LINUX, check this link (Using FSL from MATLAB) Plase download SPM12 using this link Please, check Oryx-MRSI Github Repository. Please, clone the repository, or download. See the figure below. 4.3 Before Use Oryx-MRSI Addpath Oryx-MRSI with subfolders. Addpath SPM12 with subfolders. Please make sure that FSL usage from Matlab command window installation is completed properly. Before running a data analysis using Oryx-MRSI, let’s check that FSL usage is from Matlab is done. Please open matlab and run check_fsl_usage_from_matlab.m script which is given under Oryx-MRSI Github repo. If there is no error, FSL usage from Matlab is completely installed. If you get an error, plese check these: If you use MAC, check this link (Advance Usage part-Using FSL from MATLAB) If you use LINUX, check this link (Using FSL from MATLAB) 4.4 How to organize your raw data If you want to go through with your own data set, the folder of data structure given below will help you. There is a dataset folder under Oryx-MRSI. Each patient should be listed under that folder. Each patient should have T1w-MRI, T2w-MRI or both. If you have T1w-MRI, ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/images/T1/nifti/ PatientName_Bet.nii.gz If you have T2w-MRI, ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/images/T2/nifti/ PatientName_Bet.nii.gz You need .sdat&amp;.spar data and LCModel outputs. For spectra, ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/PatientName_press_1_raw_act.sdat ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/PatientName_press_1_raw_act.spar ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/PatientName_press_1_raw_ref.sdat ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/PatientName_press_1_raw_ref.spar For LCModel outputs at press_1; ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/lcmodel_outputs/PatientName_press_1_raw_act/ Each folder has to have .coord and .table files. They need to be named as; PatientName_press_1_raw_act_sl1_4-7.coord (It shows slice 1, row 4, column 7) PatientName_press_1_raw_act_sl1_4-7.table (It shows slice 1, row 4, column 7) "],["applications.html", "Chapter 5 Applications 5.1 Oryx-MRSI GUI Tutorial 5.2 Starting Oryx-MRSI", " Chapter 5 Applications 5.1 Oryx-MRSI GUI Tutorial This tutorial describes each step of the Oryx-MRSI analysis workflow using the graphical user interface.

Click the select Spar or MRS-NIfTI file button , open dataset folder under Oryx-MRSI repository in your drive. Choose an example dataset or select your own dataset (Please, follow the steps at here (link)). Provide information for MRSI acquisition after T1w-MRI or T2w-MRI.
