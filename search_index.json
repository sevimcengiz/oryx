Oryx- MRSI functionality includes chemical shift correction, segmentation, tissue fraction calculation, metabolite maps generation, registration of metabolite maps onto MNI152 brain atlas, ROI analysis and distributions for metabolite concentration and ratio estimation at different brain. Oryx-MRSI Github Repository Link Oryx-MRSI was programmed in MATLAB 2020a (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA).The software asks for some parameters before the data analysis.The user needs to provide parameters for the multi-slice 1H-MRSI data. Required parameters: Exclusion criteria for fCSF, SNR, FWHM, CRLB RF bandwidhth of the system for chemical shift correction Cut-off value for the probabilistic binary map after registration Chemical shift correction is On or Off RFOV dir is RL or AP Chemical shift dir (AP) is A or P Chemical shift dir (LR) is L or R Chemical shift dir (FH) is F or H Reference metabolite Load Data reads the raw 1H-MRSI data (Spar or MRS-NIfTI file) and LCModel .coord otput files for raw data and Coord file visualization of spectra. Co-registration Coregisters FOV,Press-Box(VOI), all voxels of spectra considering chemical shift correction if chemical shift correction is ‘On’. Segmentation Calculation of WM, GM, CSF fractions in each voxel of all metabolites considering chemical shift correction. CRLB-FWHM-SNR Visualization of CRLB, FWHM and SNR values for all voxels in all views. Spectral Quality Visualization of included voxels into the 1H-MRSI data analysis after exclusion criteria values considering FWHM, SNR, CRLB, and fCSF. Metabolite Map All metabolite results are used to create metabolite maps including: – concentration map, – concentration map to Ins ratio, – concentration map to Cr+PCr ratio, – CSF corrected concentration map, – CSF corrected concentration map to Ins ratio, – CSF corrected concentration map to Cr+PCr ratio. Registration Generates MNI152 brain atlas-Registered metabolite maps including the outputs created in the previous module. ROI Analysis Region of interest (ROI) analysis at multiple brain atlases like Schafer2018 100/400 Parcels on 7 resting-state (rs-fMRI) networks or MNI thr 0/25/50 brain regions. Distributions This module shows a box plot of a selected metabolite’s distribution at a selected region for a visual assessment. 2.2 Release Version 1.1 2.3 Licencing Apache-2.0 License 2.4 Developers Sevim Cengiz Muhammed Yildirim Abdullah Bas Esin Ozturk Isik Should you publish material that made use of Oryx-MRSI, please cite the following publication: ORYX-MRSI: A Fully-Automated Open-Source Software for Three-Dimensional Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging Data Analysis Sevim Cengiz, Muhammed Yildirim, Abdullah Bas, Esin Ozturk-Isik bioRxiv 2021.11.12.468398; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.468398 Cengiz S, Yildirim M, Bas A, Ozturk-Isik E.

"],["literature.html", "Chapter 3 Literature", " Chapter 3 Literature This is the user documentation for Oryx-MRSI, the fully-automated open-source software for post-processing and clinic analysis of in-vivo multi-slice magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI). It doesn’t require high MRS experience from the user. Oryx-MRSI uses 1H-MRSI data acquired from Philips MR Scanner and anatomical images of different Magnetic Resonance Image (MRI) modalities including (T1 weighted MRI (T1w-MRI), T2 weighted MRI (T2w-MRI). Example datasets included .sdat &amp; .spar of MRSI, and T1w-MRI and T2w-MRI were shared in Github repository (1 control, 1 parkinson’s disease, 4 different phantom acquisition trials for chemical shift).

If you want to install FSL into your computer, check this link If you use MAC, check this link (Advance Usage part-Using FSL from MATLAB) If you use LINUX, check this link (Using FSL from MATLAB) Plase download SPM12 using this link Please, check Oryx-MRSI Github Repository. Please, clone the repository, or download. See the figure below. 4.3 Before Use Oryx-MRSI Addpath Oryx-MRSI with subfolders. Addpath SPM12 with subfolders. Please make sure that FSL usage from Matlab command window installation is completed properly. Before running a data analysis using Oryx-MRSI, let’s check that FSL usage is from Matlab is done. Please open matlab and run check_fsl_usage_from_matlab.m script which is given under Oryx-MRSI Github repo. If there is no error, FSL usage from Matlab is completely installed.
