Oryx- MRSI functionality includes chemical shift correction, segmentation, tissue fraction calculation, metabolite maps generation, registration of metabolite maps onto MNI152 brain atlas, ROI analysis and distributions for metabolite concentration and ratio estimation at different brain. Oryx-MRSI Github Repository Link Oryx-MRSI YouTube Tutorial Videos Link1 Link2 Link3 Link4 Oryx-MRSI was programmed in MATLAB 2020a (The Mathworks Inc., Natick, MA).The software asks for some parameters before the data analysis.The user needs to provide parameters for the multi-slice 1H-MRSI data. Required parameters: Exclusion criteria for fCSF, SNR, FWHM, CRLB RF bandwidhth of the system for chemical shift correction Cut-off value for the probabilistic binary map after registration Chemical shift correction is On or Off RFOV dir is RL or AP Chemical shift dir (AP) is A or P Chemical shift dir (LR) is L or R Chemical shift dir (FH) is F or H Reference metabolite Load Data reads the raw 1H-MRSI data (Spar or MRS-NIfTI file) and LCModel .coord otput files for raw data and Coord file visualization of spectra. Co-registration Coregisters FOV,Press-Box(VOI), all voxels of spectra considering chemical shift correction if chemical shift correction is ‘On’. Segmentation Calculation of WM, GM, CSF fractions in each voxel of all metabolites considering chemical shift correction. CRLB-FWHM-SNR Visualization of CRLB, FWHM and SNR values for all voxels in all views. Spectral Quality Visualization of included voxels into the 1H-MRSI data analysis after exclusion criteria values considering FWHM, SNR, CRLB, and fCSF. Metabolite Map All metabolite results are used to create metabolite maps including: – concentration map, – concentration map to Ins ratio, – concentration map to Cr+PCr ratio, – CSF corrected concentration map, – CSF corrected concentration map to Ins ratio, – CSF corrected concentration map to Cr+PCr ratio. Registration Generates MNI152 brain atlas-Registered metabolite maps including the outputs created in the previous module. ROI Analysis Region of interest (ROI) analysis at multiple brain atlases like Schafer2018 100/400 Parcels on 7 resting-state (rs-fMRI) networks or MNI thr 0/25/50 brain regions. Distributions This module shows a box plot of a selected metabolite’s distribution at a selected region for a visual assessment. 2.2 Release Version 1.1 2.3 Licencing Apache-2.0 License 2.4 Developers Sevim Cengiz Muhammed Yildirim Abdullah Bas Esin Ozturk Isik Should you publish material that made use of Oryx-MRSI, please cite the following publication: ORYX-MRSI: A Fully-Automated Open-Source Software for Three-Dimensional Proton Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopic Imaging Data Analysis Sevim Cengiz, Muhammed Yildirim, Abdullah Bas, Esin Ozturk-Isik bioRxiv 2021.11.12.468398; doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.11.12.468398 Cengiz S, Yildirim M, Bas A, Ozturk-Isik E.

(For more information, see this) Please, make sure that FSL command can be used via Matlab and run check_fsl_usage_from_matlab.m (For more information, see this) Let’s start with Oryx-MRSI. At the MATLAB prompt, enter Oryx It will display the Oryx-MRSI main Page. Selecting data and providing information. Click the select .spar file button ,and open dataset folder under Oryx-MRSI repository in your drive. Selecting data and providing information. Click the select .spar file button ,and open dataset folder under Oryx-MRSI repository in your drive. Choose an example dataset or select your own dataset (Please, follow the steps at here link). Provide information for MRSI acquisition after T1w-MRI or T2w- MRI. Provide information for the chemical shift correction. (Recommended is ON if you have the system RF bandwidths information) If chemical shift correction is on, please provide information shown in the figure. Please, select reference metabolite for chemical shift correction. Please, provide cut-off values for automated spectral quality. Please, provide cut-off value for the probabilistic binary map after MNI152 brain atlas registration. Please, click Done button. Done 4.2 Load Module This module reads the raw 1H-MRSI data, LCModel .coord output files, and allows for a visualization of the spectra. Click, for the magnification of the selected spectra. 4.3 Co-registration Module If chemical shift correction is ON, then the chemical shift misregistration amount is calculated for each metabolite using the selected metabolite as the reference and RF pulse bandwidths for each direction provided on the Main Page. Then, a metabolic map is shifted into its respective location considering the MR image space data order. Afterwards, the field of view (FOV), the PRESS box, and each voxel within the FOV are co-registered onto anatomical MR image for each metabolite map followed by the visualization of the shifted metabolite maps. 4.4 Segmentation Module After white matter (WM), gray matter (GM), and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) are segmented from a T1-weighted MRI using SPM12, the module calculates the WM, GM and CSF fractions (fWM, fGM, and fCSF) in each voxel for every metabolite, which vary due to chemical shift misregistration.Figure shows the fCSF, fWM and fGM maps for a selected metabolite (NAA+NAAG) at one slice. This part might take 30 minutes. 4.5 FWHM &amp; SNR Module This module reads LCModel .table files to get FWHM and SNR values of each voxel to create and visualize multivoxel FWHM and SNR maps. 4.6 Spectral Quality Module This module displays voxels included in the 1H-MRSI data analysis for each metabolite after the FWHM, SNR, CRLB, and fCSF exclusion criteria defined on the Main Page are applied. 4.7 Metabolite Map Module The LCModel .table files are parsed using a text reader and each metabolite result is positioned into a 3D grid in accordance with the MR image space data to create several maps, which are the concentration, CSF corrected concentra- tion (C=C0*(1/(1-fCSF))), and concentration or CSF corrected concentration to Ins and Cr+PCr ratio maps. Currently, these maps are created for nine dif- ferent metabolites, which are Cr+PCr, Glu+Gln, GPC+PCh, Ins, Lac, Lip13a, Lip13b, Lip13a+Lip13b. 4.8 Registration Module This modules registers the reference anatomical MRI onto MNI152 brain at- las using FMRIB’s Linear Image Registration Tool (FSL FLIRT) to obtain a transformation matrix. Then, this transformation matrix is used to register the PRESS box and all the concentration or ratio maps that were previously co-registered to the anatomical MRI onto the MNI152 brain atlas. The user pro- vides a cutoff value for the probabilistic maps, (at the main page), which are produced as a result of registration, and all the pixels that exceed this threshold are included in the data analysis. 4.9 ROI Analysis The metabolic maps are currently evaluated at different brain regions to define a mean, median and standard deviation value of the concentration map of interest at these brain regions. A result is produced for a parcellation if only more than provided value at the ROI Analyze page% of its pixels are included within the metabolite map of interest.
