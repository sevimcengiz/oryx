"],["features.html", "Chapter 4 Features", " Chapter 4 Features Main Page The user needs to provide parameters for the 3D multivoxel 1H-MRSI data. Required parameters: exclusion criteria for fCSF, SNR, FWHM, CRLB RF bandwidhth of the system for chemical shift correction cut-off value for the probabilistic binary map after registration Load Data Reads the raw 1H-MRSI data and LCModel otput files for raw data and Coord file visualization of spectra. Co-registration Coregisters FOV,Press-Box(VOI), all voxels of spectra considering chemical shift correction if chemical shift correction is ‘On.’ Segmentation Calculation of WM, GM, CSF fractions in each voxel of all metabolites considering chemical shift correction. FWHM-SNR Visualization of FWHM and SNR values for all voxels Included Voxels Visualization of included voxels into the 1H-MRSI data analysis after exclusion criteria values considering FWHM, SNR, CRLB, and fCSF. Metabolite Map All metabolite results are used to create metabolite maps including: concentration map, concentation map to Ins or Cr+PCr ratio CSF corrected concentration map, CSF corrected concentration map to Ins or Cr+PCr ratio. Registration Generates MNI-Registered metabolite maps including the outputs created in the previous module. ROI Analysis Region of interest (ROI) analysis at multiple brain atlases like Schafer2018 100/400 Parcels on 7 resting-state (rs-fMRI) networks* or MNI thr 0/25/50 brain regions*.

If you want to install FSL into your computer, check this link If you use MAC, check this link (Advance Usage part-Using FSL from MATLAB) If you use LINUX, check this link (Using FSL from MATLAB) Please download SPM12 using this link Please, check Oryx-MRSI Github Repository. Please, clone the repository, or download. See the figure below. 9.3 Before Use Oryx-MRSI Addpath Oryx-MRSI with subfolders. Addpath SPM12 with subfolders. Please make sure that FSL usage from Matlab command window installation is completed properly. Before running a data analysis using Oryx-MRSI, let’s check that FSL usage is from Matlab is done. Please open matlab and run check_fsl_usage_from_matlab.m script which is given under Oryx-MRSI Github repo. If there is no error, FSL usage from Matlab is completely installed. If you get an error, plese check these: If you use MAC, check this link (Advance Usage part-Using FSL from MATLAB) If you use LINUX, check this link (Using FSL from MATLAB) 9.4 How to organize your raw data If you want to go through with your own data set, the folder of data structure given below will help you. There is a dataset folder under Oryx-MRSI. Each patient should be listed under that folder. Each patient should have T1w-MRI, T2w-MRI or both. If you have T1w-MRI, ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/images/T1/nifti/ PatientName_Bet.nii.gz If you have T2w-MRI, ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/images/T2/nifti/ PatientName_Bet.nii.gz You need .sdat&amp;.spar data and LCModel outputs. For spectra, ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/PatientName_press_1_raw_act.sdat ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/PatientName_press_1_raw_act.spar ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/PatientName_press_1_raw_ref.sdat ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/PatientName_press_1_raw_ref.spar For LCModel outputs at press_1; ~/Oryx-MRSI/Dataset/PatientName/exam_1/spectra/lcmodel_outputs/PatientName_press_1_raw_act/ Each folder has to have .coord and .table files. They need to be named as; PatientName_press_1_raw_act_sl1_4-7.coord (It shows slice 1, row 4, column 7) PatientName_press_1_raw_act_sl1_4-7.table (It shows slice 1, row 4, column 7) "],["methods.html", "Chapter 10 Methods", " Chapter 10 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.
