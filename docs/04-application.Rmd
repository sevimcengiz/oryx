## Oryx-MRSI GUI Tutorial

This tutorial describes each step of the Oryx-MRSI analysis workflow using the graphical user interface.
We will learn how to start the GUI, select the spar file, select requirements information an the Main Gui Page and it will enables us to use 8 different modules. 

## Starting Oryx-MRSI

Please, make sure that SPM12 and ORYX-MRSI folders in the addpath with subfolders. (For more information, see this(link))
Please, make sure that FSL command can be used via Matlab and run ```check_fsl_usage_from_matlab.m``` (For more information, see this(link))

Letâ€™s start with Oryx-MRSI.

At the MATLAB prompt, enter
