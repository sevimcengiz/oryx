# Oryx-MRSI GUI Tutorial

This tutorial describes each step of the Oryx-MRSI analysis using the graphical user interface. We will learn how to start the GUI, select the spar file, select re- quirements information an the Main Gui Page and then Oryx-MRSI will enable us to use 8 different modules.

## Starting Oryx-MRSI

Please, make sure that SPM12 and ORYX-MRSI folders in the addpath with subfolders. 
(For more information, see this)

Please, make sure that FSL command can be used via Matlab and run check_fsl_usage_from_matlab.m (For more information, see this)

Letâ€™s start with Oryx-MRSI. At the MATLAB prompt, enter

>> Oryx

It will display the Oryx-MRSI main Page.

Please, click Done button.

Done

## Load Module

This module reads the raw 1H-MRSI data, LCModel .coord output files, and allows for a visualization of the spectra.
